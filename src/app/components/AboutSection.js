        <h3>Junior Full Stack Developer</h3>
        <p>
          I'm a recent graduate of Code Institute with a strong foundation in
          coding and a unique background as a professional chef. My experience
          in the culinary world has equipped me with invaluable
          skills—precision, creativity, and the ability to thrive in fast-paced,
          high-pressure environments. As a chef, I’ve learned the art of
          adapting quickly, solving complex problems, and collaborating
          seamlessly with a team to achieve the best results. Now, I’m eager to
          transfer these skills into the tech field, where I can channel my
          drive for excellence into building, optimizing, and improving digital
          solutions.

            At Code Institute, I honed my skills in web development, learning
            core technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python, and gained
            hands-on experience with project-based learning. My journey from the
            kitchen to the code editor has taught me that while the tools may
            differ, the principles of dedication, resilience, and creativity
            remain the same. I am actively seeking an opportunity in tech where
            I can leverage my unique perspective, continue to learn, and
            contribute meaningfully to innovative projects.
